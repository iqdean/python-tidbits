As you can see below - 'rsync' is faster by more than 10%, and has a handy indicator -- where 'cp' does not.

Speed test:
Code:
"time rsync -varh --progress (15G folder/29650 files) (some destination on same drive)"

OUTPUT
total size is 15.02G
real	4m28.815s
user	0m59.163s
sys	0m27.270s


"time cp -a (15G folder/29650 files) (some destination on same drive)"

OUTPUT
real	6m12.800s
user	0m1.418s
sys	0m21.759s


Progress indicator test:
Code:
"rsync -varh --progress (something) (somewhere)"

Output
/dir/dir/dir/file.txt 24.69M 100%   74.51MB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#28470, to-check=340/29650)[/QUOTE]


"cp -a (something) (somewhere)"
